[[_definition_Activated_Service]]
Activated Service or Service Instance::
An Activated Service is an instance of a service. It is characterized by a Service ID and an Instance ID.

[[_definition_Action]]
Action::
An action will launch a workflow on an instance modifying its status.
An action is characterized by < a Service ID called pca.service.id in the liste of the workflow Generic Information + a workflow ID + a state called pca.states in the liste of the workflow Generic Information> 
There are two Specific kinds of Actions: 
- *Activation* Actions that can start a service instance (from state VOID)
- *Finishing* Actions that can stop a service instance (to state FINISHED)

[[_definition_States]]
States::
The specific states that are defined in PCA are VOID, FINISHED, ERROR, KILLED.

- *VOID* Implicit State before a Service is Activated
- *FINISHED* Implicit State after a Service is terminated/no longer Activated
- *ERROR* Something wrong happened
- *KILLED* When PCA abnormally forces an Activated Service to terminate.

NOTE: Please note that users are free to define their own custom States (e.g. RUNNING, SUSPENDED, ...)

[[_definition_Endpoints]]
Endpoints::
Endpoints are a list of Key/Value, 
  e.g. [(Swarm, <smarmendpoint>), (HDFS, <hdfs-endpoint>), (Spark, <spark-endpoint>)]

[[_definition_Service_Name_Infrastructure_Name]]
Service_Name, Infrastructure_Name::
Service_Name, Infrastructure_Name are Service specific, PCA does not know about them.
If a service wants it, it can be stored in the data associated to a service.
