*ProActive Cloud Automation (PCA)* allows to automate service deployment, together with their life-cycle management. Services are instantiated by workflows (executed as a Job by the Scheduler), and related workflows allow to move services from state to state. At any point in time, each service instance has a specific state (RUNNING, ERROR, FINISH, etc.). 
Attached to each Service Instance, PCA service stores several information: 
Service Instance Id, Service Id, State, the ordered list of Jobs executed for the service, a set of Variables with Values (a Map, that includes for instance service endpoint).
