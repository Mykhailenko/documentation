=== Introduction
The <<_glossary_job_planner,*Job Planner*>> schedules <<_glossary_workflow,*Workflows*>>.
 A <<_glossary_workflow,*Workflow*>> is scheduled by the <<_glossary_job_planner,*Job Planner*>> if
  it is associated to a <<_glossary_calendars_definition,*Calendar Definition*>>.

=== Job Planner Submission

==== Creating Calendar Definitions

To create new calendar definition, use the <<_glossary_job_planner_portal, *Job Planner Portal*>>, Calendar Definition page. When clicking the "+" button, a calendar definition is created with default parameters.

Click on a Calendar Definition to modify it. Its fields will be visible on the main panel ("Calendar Definition"). The name of the Calendar Definition must be unique in a bucket. The cron expression can be set using the widget, or manually with the "Advanced" tab. The resulting cron expression is shown under the widget.

Changes made in the Calendar Definition panel will be automatically saved. When a calendar definition is selected, it can be removed by clicking on the trash button.

==== Associating workflows to Calendar Definitions

Once a workflow has been published to the <<_glossary_catalog, *Catalog*>>, it can be planned with the <<_glossary_job_planner_portal, *Job Planner Portal*>>, Calendar Association page. To plan a workflow, you need to associate it to a Calendar Definition.

On this page, select an already existing Calendar Definition and add/remove workflows associated to it.
When creating an association, it is possible to set the workflows variables.

This page can also be opened when clicking on the "plan" button on the <<_glossary_workflow_studio, *Studio*>> or the <<_glossary_scheduler_web_interface, *Scheduler Portal*>>.

==== Execution Planning visualisation

On the <<_glossary_job_planner_portal, *Job Planner Portal*>>, Execution Planning page, you can see the recurrence of calendar definitions.
You can select one or several Calendar Definitions on the left panel and associated workflows will appear on the right panel.

Then, there are 3 ways to visualize the recurrence on the Execution Planning panel:

    - "Sort by workflow" tab: For each workflow, a list of execution time is displayed. The combo box allows you to choose the period of the execution planning. If several workflows are associated to one Calendar Definition, they will be grouped.
    If a workflow is associated to several Calendar Definitions, it will appear several times.  The name of the Calendar Definition is always displayed next to the workflow name, in order to know which Calendar Definition is related to the given executions.
    - "Sort chronologically" tab : All executions are displayed chronologically in a list, with for each execution, the workflow that will be executed and the corresponding Calendar Definition.
    The combo box allows you to choose the period of the execution planning.
    - "Calendar" tab : You can see the execution planning of the selected Calendar Definitions, by year/month/week or day. In the year and month views, you can see the number of executions in one month/day.
    If you click on it, you can see more details on which workflows are executed and when. In the week view, if several workflows are executed at the same time, you will only be able to see one at a time.

If a calendar has no association, you can still select it and see its recurrence on the Execution Planning panel.
If nothing is displayed, it means the selected Calendar Definitions have no recurrence on the selected period.

=== Calendar Definition Syntax

Job Planner uses a  Calendar Definition to know how the job will be planned over the time. As shown on the example below, this definition is composed of 4 fields:

 - a description (saying what the cron expression means, when to use the Calendar Definition, etc.)
 - a cron expression to define the recurrence (every morning at 6am, etc.)
 - a set of inclusions calendars to add specific job executions which cannot be defined by a cron expression (holidays, etc.)
 - a set of exclusions calendars to exclude specific occurrences of the job executions defined in cron and inclusion definitions (maintenances operations, holidays, etc.)

Based on the above configuration, the following JSON object will be stored in the <<_glossary_catalog, *Catalog*>>.

----
{
   "description":"Every Week Day at 9:00 AM including holidays (except Christmas and Easter holidays)",
   "cron":"0 0 9 ? * MON-FRI *",
   "inclusion_calendars":[
      {
         "calendar":{
            "url":"http://localhost:8080/all_holidays_calendar.ics"
         },
         "rule":{
            "action":"EXECUTE_AT_START"
         }
      }
   ],
   "exclusion_calendars":[
      {
         "calendar":{
            "url":"http://localhost:8080/christmas_holidays_calendar.ics"
         },
         "rule":{
            "action":"CANCEL_NEXT_EXECUTION"
         }
      },
      {
         "calendar":{
            "url":"http://localhost:8080/easter_holidays_calendar.ics"
         },
         "rule":{
            "action":"CANCEL_NEXT_EXECUTION"
         }
      }
   ]
}

==== Description

The description allows users who are not familiar with cron expressions to know when it will occur. It might also be used for other purpose, for example saying when to use a Calendar Definition.

==== Cron

The aim of the cron expression is to launch the planned workflow according to the cron syntax.
One can see the cron expression "0 0 9 ? * MON-FRI *", which follows the quartz cron expression syntax explained in the
<<_job_planner_cron_expression_syntax, Quartz Cron Expression Syntax>> section. The cron expression in this example
 executes at 9:00 AM on working days (Monday to Friday).


==== Inclusion Calendar

The purpose of the inclusion calendar section is to use an ICS file to specify a workflow launching policies during calendar events. For instance automatically
submit a worklfow at event start. Given an event, a predefined action will be applied on the workflow execution.

[cols="1,1", options="header"]
|===

|Inclusion action
|Description

|EXECUTE_AT_START
|The workflow will be submitted at each event start.

|===

==== Exclusion Calendar

The purpose of the exclusion calendar is to use an ICS file to prevent workflows to be executed during a calendar event. 
Given an event, a predefined action will be applied on the workflow execution.

[cols="1,1", options="header"]
|===

|Exclusion action
|Description

|CANCEL_NEXT_EXECUTION
|All workflow submissions are canceled during the calendar events.

|===

==== External calendar retrieved from URL

If an inclusion or exclusion calendar is not retrievable, it is blocking the <<_glossary_workflow,*Workflow*>> submission.
An inclusion or exclusion calendar can become not retrievable if it cannot be downloaded from its URL and the
<<_glossary_job_planner,*Job Planner*>> cache doesn't hold a copy.
